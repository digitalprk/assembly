# Old Assembly projects

Some assembly programs I coded 15 to 20 years ago :)

### 1. Dockbar

A simple dockbar to supplement the Windows Shell. Add shortcuts by drag-and-dropping icons over the bar or custom groups of shortcuts using scripts. Can be dragged around to dock on the horizontal or vertical side of your screen. The color and some other aspects of the bar can be changed by modifying the options.ini configuration file. Originally created for Windows XP but surprisingly still works on Windows 10.
